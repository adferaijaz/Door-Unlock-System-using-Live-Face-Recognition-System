# Live-Face-Detection-cum-Recognition-based-Access-Management-System
Although Face Recognition Systems are known for decades, there are many well active research works on the topic. These can be divided into two main parts; face detection and recognition of the detected face. So during our research we have found many areas that related to face recognition system; such as processes approaches and algorithms that used in developing of those systems. In developing this feature we will be using the data model diagram to show these processes and stages. This data model diagram will help us in making decision that will give us a good idea to the development stages like locating face in a form of color image, also will help us in retrieval of information as well as storing the record for further usage in time. 
Product Perspective :
The real challenge in face detection and recognition technologies is the ability to handle all those difference face that where subjects for trained. In our project first we are going to review the development of face detection and recognition approaches, followed by a review of face modeling and model compression methods. After development of this project, Face Recognition System will able to detected and recognized each difference faces where subject to trained.


System Interfaces Requirement
During development process, Face Recognition System, face images acquiring depends upon application. For instance, in system applications may function as or served by capturing face images with means of camera also save image into database. After saving image into database, if person detected and recognized by returning known or unknown. So all the process explain how user will interact with the system.


User Interface Requirement Analysis
In Face Recognition System users are able to interact with application after login. User will login using password and username, because the system is planned to provide authentication to the person in charge of system in order to maintain high level security.
