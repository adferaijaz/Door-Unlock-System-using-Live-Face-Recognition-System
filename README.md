# Live-Face-Detection-cum-Recognition-based-Access-Management-System
1. METHOD/APPROACH
1.1. Overall Description
Although Face Recognition Systems are known for decades, there are many well active research works on the topic. These can be divided into two main parts; face detection and recognition of the detected face. So during our research we have found many areas that related to face recognition system; such as processes approaches and algorithms that used in developing of those systems. In developing this feature we will be using the data model diagram to show these processes and stages. This data model diagram will help us in making decision that will give us a good idea to the development stages like locating face in a form of color image, also will help us in retrieval of information as well as storing the record for further usage in time.
1.2. Product Perspective
The real challenge in face detection and recognition technologies is the ability to handle all those difference face that where subjects for trained. In our project first we are going to review the development of face detection and recognition approaches, followed by a review of face modeling and model compression methods. After development of this project, Face Recognition System will able to detected and recognized each difference faces where subject to trained.
1.3. System Interfaces Requirement
During development process, Face Recognition System, face images acquiring depends upon application. For instance, in system applications may function as or served by capturing face images with means of camera also save image into database. After saving image into database, if person detected and recognized by returning known or unknown. So all the process explain how user will interact with the system. 
1.4. User Interface Requirement Analysis
In Face Recognition System users are able to interact with application after login. User will login using password and username, because the system is planned to provide authentication to the person in charge of system in order to maintain high level security. Then the main interface will display after login, the user will be able to capture image instantly, delete, insert new track image, update an image or update specific record. Also user is able to search all record of a specific person. 

Face Recognition System is planned to get the face region particularly, the face region will serve as the input that will be used in matching with other records in the system. The phases in face detection and recognition are as follows: Image captured from the camera, face region detected, searching, matching display and updating the particular image or saving the new record. All this explain the different steps of an image face detection process.\

1.5. Hardware Interfaces
The system hardware interfaces is one of the most essential issue in this planned work or project, because capturing image has the priority in all the stages, so external Camera/Webcam is required in the process. Record will be inputted with the help of mouse, keyboard and the output result will be obtain from the screen display image and even speakers might be used to make it more user friendly by producing a sound that shows valid or invalid activity. Some of hardware interfaces.
a) A personal computer with 6GB RAM running on Intel Core i-5.
b) CPU speed of 2.40GHz,
c) 500GB of harddisk space were used to experiment and test the program.
d) Accessories: WebCam, Keyboard & Mouse.

1.6. Software Requirements
Operating system: Microsoft Windows 10.
 Programming Language : Visual Studio 2012 with C#
Library Emgu Cv, Open Cv
Database : Microsoft Access 2013

1.7. Software Interface
This application is Windows based application that runs on laptops, desktop computers, and the developed software will be used or run on all the major operating systems like Windows, Mac system or UNIX. This application will have access to camera that connected to the system for image processing. The database structure of this application is one of the most important parts after the camera, because there will be track of records and all the details and even the images will be kept in the database. The added records might be updated, deleted or searched using DBMS.
